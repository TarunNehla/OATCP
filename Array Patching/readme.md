Algorithm : 
* First it read the input s (size of the vector v) and then reads the vector v and then the value n
* The program initializes four variables: p to 0, c to 1, x to 0.
* The program then enters a while loop that continues until c is greater than n. 
* Inside the loop, if x is less than s and the xth element of v is less than or equal to c, it adds the xth element of v to c and increments x.
* Otherwise, it doubles the value of c and increments p.
* Finally, the program prints the value of p and ends.
