Algorithm : 
* Read the input value of 'n'.
* Create an empty vector 'v' to store 'n' integers.
* Iterate 'n' times and read integers from input, adding them to vector 'v'.
* Convert each integer in 'v' to a string and store them in vector 'str'.
* Sort the strings in 'str' in descending order using the 'compare' function.
* Concatenate all the strings in 'str' to form the final answer 'ans'.
* If the first character of 'ans' is '0', output '0'. Otherwise, output 'ans'.
