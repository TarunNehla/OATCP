Algorithm : 
* Read the value of 'n' from the input.
* Create an empty vector 'v' to store the input values.
* Read 'n' integers from the input and push them into the vector 'v'.
* Read the value of 'k' from the input.
* Sort the vector 'v' in ascending order.
* Iterate over the elements of 'v' and count the number of elements that are less than or equal to 'k'. Subtract the value of each element from 'k' until it becomes less than the current element. 
* Print the count as the answer.
